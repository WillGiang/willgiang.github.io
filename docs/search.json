While I like Material for MkDocs and have successfully used it for hosting scope documentation for a lab spinning disk confocal microscope, I’m not yet at a point where I’d want to toss $15 / month to become an “Insider” to receive certain features.\nSurely Quarto will be what I finally settle on for a personal blog."
