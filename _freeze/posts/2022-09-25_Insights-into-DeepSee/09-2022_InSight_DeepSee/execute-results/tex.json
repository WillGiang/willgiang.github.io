After contacting the service engineer for Spectra-Physics, we learned two laser diodes were already replaced with a bill of $30k. We were also warned that the laser power had been reduced, but otherwise the DeepSee should be functional.\n\n- The liquid in the chiller unit has been flushed and replaced with coolant.\n- After turning on the microscope and laser systems, it took several days for the laser's humidity to reach acceptable levels\n- The power output has been reduced\n\n![Image of A1plus MP GUI](img/A1plus_MP_GUI.png)\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n```\n:::\n\n\n## How long does the InSight DeepSee need to effectively warm up?\n\nSept 20: Turned on all scope components and noticed humidity was too high, so I started logging it\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nhumidity_csv = \"Time_since_DeepSee_turn_on.csv\"\nhumidity_df = pd.read_csv(humidity_csv)\n\nhumidity_plot = sns.scatterplot(data = humidity_df,\n                                x = \"Time [Minutes]\",\n                                y = \"Relative Humidity [%]\",\n                               )\n\nhumidity_plot.set_title(\"Four days for humidity to stabilize from start-up\")\nhumidity_plot.set_xlim(0, 4500)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=2}\n```\n(0.0, 4500.0)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](09-2022_InSight_DeepSee_files/figure-pdf/cell-3-output-2.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## How much power did we lose as a function of wavelength?\n\n- Digitized the theoretical tuning power from the manual\n- There also appears to be a warmup time after turning emission ON\n- Severe drop in power when laser is tuned above 1000nm\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndata_csv = \"2022-09-23_laser-power-vs-wavelength_with-theoretical.csv\"\ndf = pd.read_csv(data_csv)\n\npalette = sns.color_palette(\"mako_r\", 5)\nsns.set_theme(style=\"whitegrid\")\n\ng = sns.scatterplot(data = df,\n                    x = \"Wavelength [nm]\",\n                    y = \"Power [mW]\",\n                    hue = \"Replicate\",\n                    style = \"Replicate\",\n                    palette = palette,\n                   )\n\ng.set_title(\"InSight DeepSee far from spec \\nat $\\lambda$ > 1000nm\")\ng.set_xlim(700, 1100)\ng.set_ylim(-20, 1400)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n```\n(-20.0, 1400.0)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](09-2022_InSight_DeepSee_files/figure-pdf/cell-4-output-2.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
